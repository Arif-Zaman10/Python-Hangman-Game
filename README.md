🎮 Hangman: Pokémon Edition

This is a simple Hangman game written in Python, where the player must guess the name of a Pokémon. Each wrong guess costs a life, and the Hangman drawing updates until the game is won or lost.


✨ Features

- 30 Pokémon names to guess (randomly chosen each game).
- ASCII-art hangman that updates as you lose lives.
- Prevents repeated guesses from being counted again.
- Win condition when the full Pokémon name is revealed.
- Lose condition when you run out of 6 lives.


🔮 Future Improvements

- Add more Pokémon names (from different generations).
- Add difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
- Add a scoring system for multiple rounds.
- Option to play again without restarting the program.
